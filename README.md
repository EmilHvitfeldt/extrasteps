The goal of extrasteps is to provide additional steps for
[recipes](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes). These steps are
located in this package because they donâ€™t fit well in
[recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) or [any of
the](https://textrecipes.tidymodels.org/)
[extension](https://embed.tidymodels.org/)
[packages](https://themis.tidymodels.org/).

> \[!IMPORTANT\]  
> These steps work, but they are not tested as rigorously as the steps
> in tidymodels packages. Hence why they are in this package. Also note
> that steps can graduate from {extrasteps} to {recipes}, if they prove
> their worth.
